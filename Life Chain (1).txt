Abstract
The current landscape of medical record-keeping is fragmented, siloed, and heavily dependent
on disparate systems and physical documents. This decentralization results in incomplete
patient histories, places an unreliable burden on patient memory, and creates barriers to
longitudinal monitoring and international healthcare delivery. This project proposes the
development of a unified global healthcare ecosystem designed to consolidate a patient’s entire
medical journey into a single, secure, and accessible digital record.
From birth, each individual will be assigned a Unique Patient ID, forming the foundation of a
lifelong health repository. All medical reports, regardless of hospital, clinic, or country of
origin, will be digitized and stored in a standardized format. An advanced OCR and data
extraction model will structure existing PDF reports seamlessly. If a hospital is subscribed to
the system, healthcare staff will input data directly, while in cases where institutions are not
yet integrated, patients will retain the ability to upload their own report PDFs, ensuring
continuity of records across all contexts.
A novel feature of this platform is the integration of a dynamic family tree. By linking the
Unique Patient IDs of blood relatives, the system can analyze familial medical histories to
identify genetic predispositions, prompting clinicians to recommend preventative screenings
and tests. Real-time translation services will extend global accessibility, breaking down
language barriers in cross-border healthcare.
The initial pilot phase will focus on the diagnosis and monitoring of Diabetes, Chronic Kidney
Disease (CKD), Parathyroid Disorders, and Iron Deficiency Anemia, while also incorporating
the detection and progression tracking of dental diseases using deep learning models. Both
patients and clinicians will have access to a shared dashboard presenting health progress,
laboratory trends, dental lesion monitoring, medication details, and treatment history. This dual
view fosters proactive engagement, continuous monitoring, and timely interventions, laying
the foundation for globally connected, data-driven healthcare.

1 Introduction
Project Title: LifeChain AI
A Unified Global Healthcare Ecosystem for Lifelong Medical Record Management and
Genetic Risk Analysis

1.1 Background
The management of healthcare data in the contemporary world is characterized by significant
fragmentation. Patient information is typically scattered across numerous healthcare providers,
stored in incompatible proprietary systems, and often exists only in physical or nonstandardized digital formats such as PDFs. This decentralization creates critical inefficiencies
and risks: clinicians must make decisions with incomplete patient histories, longitudinal
tracking of chronic diseases becomes challenging, and the burden of recalling medical history
falls unreliably upon the patient. In an increasingly globalized world, accessing medical records
across international borders further presents formidable logistical and linguistic barriers,
complicating care for travelers, expatriates, and individuals seeking specialized treatment
abroad.
3 of 16

A major gap in current systems is the absence of a unified, data-driven approach to lifelong
health monitoring and preventative care. Existing practices such as family history assessment
are typically manual and dependent on patient knowledge, leaving significant room for error
and missed opportunities. Similarly, chronic conditions such as Diabetes, Chronic Kidney
Disease (CKD), Parathyroid Disorders, and Iron Deficiency Anemia often require continuous
monitoring through laboratory data, yet current infrastructures rarely support seamless
integration of longitudinal reports across institutions. Dental diseases, despite being highly
prevalent and impactful on systemic health, also lack consistent digital monitoring tools
capable of detecting and tracking progression over time.
This project directly addresses these shortcomings by proposing an integrated digital ecosystem
that consolidates a patient’s entire medical journey, from birth to death, into a single, lifelong
record. By combining automated report digitization, dynamic family tree analysis for
hereditary risk prediction, and AI-driven monitoring of chronic and dental conditions, the
system aims to transform fragmented, reactive healthcare into a globally connected, proactive,
and data-driven model of care.

1.2 Project Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to design, develop, and evaluate a proof-of-concept for
a unified global healthcare platform. The system will be built upon the principle of a single,
lifelong medical record for every individual, securely accessible from anywhere in the world.
The specific goals are as follows:
● To establish a system architecture centered around a Unique Patient ID, serving as a
universal key for all medical records.
● To design and implement a Unified Medical Report Structure that standardizes data
from disparate sources and ensures interoperability across hospitals and clinics.
● To develop an automated data ingestion pipeline using OCR and AI models to extract
and structure information from PDF-based medical reports, with fallback for manual
patient uploads when institutions are not directly integrated.
● To create a Family Tree module that links patient profiles, enabling the identification
and early flagging of potential hereditary disease risks.
● To integrate real-time translation services to ensure medical records are accessible
and understandable across linguistic and regional barriers.
● To validate the system’s efficacy through a pilot phase that supports the diagnosis
and monitoring of Diabetes, Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), Parathyroid
Disorders, Iron Deficiency Anemia, and dental diseases, leveraging AI-driven
models for both structured lab-data analysis and deep learning–based dental lesion
detection and progression tracking.
● To provide dual dashboards for patients and clinicians, enabling continuous
monitoring, medication tracking, health trend visualization, and informed decisionmaking throughout the care journey.

1.3 Methodology and Sub-Tasks
The project will be executed through the following distinct sub-tasks:
1. System Architecture and Database Design: The core of the project will be a secure
and scalable database. A relational or NoSQL schema will be designed to store patient
demographic data, structured medical reports adhering to the unified format, and graphbased relationships for the family tree module. The architecture will support high
availability, role-based access, and interoperability across healthcare institutions.
2. Automated Data Ingestion: An intelligent data extraction module will be developed
to convert unstructured medical reports into structured formats. Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) will digitize text from PDFs, while custom-trained NLP and
computer vision models will identify, classify, and map relevant information such as
diagnoses, laboratory values, medications, and physician notes into the unified report
structure.
3. Family Tree and Genetic Risk Algorithm: A relationship graph will be implemented
by linking Unique Patient IDs across familial connections (e.g., parent–child). An
automated algorithm will traverse this graph and, upon detection of a significant
diagnosis, evaluate hereditary risk for related profiles. The module will generate alerts
or recommendations for preventative screenings based on defined clinical guidelines.
4. Pilot Applications for Validation: The system will initially be validated through
applications in both chronic and dental disease monitoring. For chronic conditions such
as Diabetes, CKD, Parathyroid Disorders, and Iron Deficiency Anemia, the platform
will track laboratory markers over time to classify patient status as “stable,”
“improving,” or “worsening.” For dental diseases, deep learning models will be
employed to detect lesions from oral images and monitor their progression
longitudinally. This dual focus will demonstrate the system’s capacity to handle both
text-based medical data and image-assisted disease tracking.
5. Global Access and Translation: A web-based interface will provide access to medical
data for both patients and clinicians. Real-time translation services will be integrated to
ensure accessibility across languages, enabling seamless international healthcare
delivery.

2 Success Criterion
The successful completion of this project will be evaluated based on a primary, verifiable
success criterion that is both comprehensive and achievable. This ensures a clear baseline for
project success, with additional achievements demonstrating the system’s potential to exceed
initial expectations.
The primary success criterion is the delivery of a functional, end-to-end prototype that
demonstrates the core workflow of the proposed platform. This criterion will be considered
met upon the successful demonstration of the following capabilities:
1. Patient and Record Creation: A user can create a new patient profile, which is
assigned a Unique Patient ID, and upload a sample PDF medical report.

5 of 16

2. Automated Data Ingestion: The system correctly processes the uploaded PDF,
extracts key information using OCR and NLP models, and populates the Unified
Medical Report Structure with relevant variables such as diagnoses, laboratory markers,
and physician notes.
3. Family Tree Risk Flagging: Linking the new patient to an existing relative (e.g., a
parent) and adding a predefined hereditary condition to the parent’s record
automatically triggers a risk notification for the patient, confirming the correct
functioning of the genetic risk algorithm.
4. Pilot Application Functionality: The system demonstrates monitoring in both
domains of focus. For chronic diseases such as Diabetes, CKD, Parathyroid Disorders,
and Iron Deficiency Anemia, the system accurately displays laboratory trends and
classifies the patient’s condition as “improving,” “stable,” or “worsening.” For dental
diseases, the platform associates oral images with the patient’s record and incorporates
the AI model’s output for lesion detection and progression status.
This core functionality will serve as the benchmark for project completion. Quantitative
performance metrics, such as OCR extraction accuracy, classification performance for chronic
disease status, and the precision/recall of AI-based dental lesion detection, will be documented
in the dissertation as evidence of the system’s robustness, representing achievements that
exceed the baseline success criterion.

3 Related works
Health record fragmentation and EHR interoperability are widely recognized problems;
systematic reviews show interoperability reduces care duplication and safety risks but that
heterogeneous formats and semantics remain major roadblocks [1]. Converting legacy paper
reports and PDFs into structured, queryable records is an active research area; state-of-the-art
pipelines now combine layout-aware OCR with domain-specific NLP (NER and relation
extraction) to achieve much higher extraction accuracy than OCR alone [2][9].
Recent work on automated family history analysis demonstrates that pedigree-aware
pipelines and graph-based representations can improve risk prediction for hereditary
conditions, motivating automated family-tree linking and risk flagging in LifeChain AI
[3][4].
For the dental pilot, there exist curated oral-cavity image datasets and histopathology datasets
(for example, the Sri Lanka annotated oral cavity image collection and the NDB-UFES
dataset) that have been used to train and benchmark CNN models for lesion detection and
classification; these resources support both detection and longitudinal progression tasks
[5][6][7].
While components for interoperability, document digitization, family-history inference, and
image-based disease detection exist, an integrated, lifelong patient record that links relatives,
supports multilingual access, and combines imaging models with structured report ingestion
remains an open practical challenge — exactly the gap this project aims to address [8]

4 Project Rationale
The fundamental purpose of this project is to address a critical and pervasive inefficiency in
modern healthcare: the fragmentation of patient medical data. Patient records are currently
scattered across institutions, stored in incompatible formats, and often remain in paper-based
or non-standardized digital forms such as PDFs. This fragmentation is more than a logistical
inconvenience—it directly affects patient safety, treatment efficacy, and healthcare costs.
Incomplete histories increase the risk of misdiagnosis, adverse drug interactions, and redundant
testing, while making the longitudinal monitoring of chronic diseases nearly impossible.
This project envisions a patient-centric healthcare model in which every individual’s complete,
lifelong medical history is consolidated into a single, secure, and universally accessible record.
By integrating automated data ingestion, structured storage, and family-tree based genetic risk
analysis, the system will not only provide continuity of care but also enable early identification
of hereditary risks. Such proactive insights can drive timely interventions and preventative
strategies, addressing gaps that traditional healthcare infrastructures are unable to cover
effectively.
The rationale for focusing initially on Diabetes, Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), Parathyroid
Disorders, Iron Deficiency Anemia, and dental diseases lies in their high prevalence, long-term
monitoring requirements, and reliance on structured laboratory or clinical data. These
conditions present a realistic yet impactful scope for demonstrating the system’s capability to
unify fragmented medical information into actionable insights.
Our motivation for undertaking this project is twofold. Firstly, it represents an opportunity to
apply advanced principles of computer science—particularly artificial intelligence, natural
language processing, computer vision, and scalable system architecture—to a real-world
challenge with global societal impact. Secondly, it offers a chance to gain practical experience
in tackling a multi-faceted technical problem, combining deep learning, healthcare informatics,
research, and project management into a cohesive, solution-oriented approach.

4.1 Aims and Objectives
The primary aim of this project is to design, develop, and evaluate a proof-of-concept for a
unified global healthcare platform. The system will be built upon the principle of a single,
lifelong medical record for every individual, securely accessible from anywhere in the world.
The specific, focused objectives to achieve this aim are as follows:
1. To establish a system architecture centered around a Unique Patient ID, serving as a
universal key for all medical records and enabling lifelong continuity of data.

unavailable.
4. To create a Family Tree module that links patient profiles and automatically flags
potential hereditary disease risks through a graph-based relationship algorithm.
5. To integrate real-time translation to ensure medical reports are understandable across
linguistic and regional barriers, enabling seamless international use.
6. To validate the system’s efficacy through a pilot application that supports the
diagnosis and monitoring of chronic diseases such as Diabetes, CKD, Parathyroid
Disorders, and Iron Deficiency Anemia, while also incorporating dental disease
detection and progression tracking using AI-driven deep learning models.

5 Proposed Methodology and Architecture
This section provides a detailed overview of the methodology, system architecture, and
technical procedures that will be employed to develop the LifeChain AI. Our approach is
designed to be systematic and iterative, ensuring that each objective outlined in the project
scope is met efficiently.

5.1 Development Methodology
To manage the LifeChain AI project effectively and accommodate the iterative nature of
research and development, an Agile development methodology will be employed, specifically
using a simplified Scrum framework. This methodology provides flexibility, promotes
incremental progress, and ensures continuous integration of feedback.
The project will be structured into two-week sprints, with each sprint dedicated to the
development of a specific, demonstrable feature.
● Sprint Planning: At the beginning of each sprint, key tasks will be selected from the
project backlog, prioritizing features that align with the system’s core objectives.
● Daily Stand-ups: Short daily meetings will be conducted to maintain
synchronization, track progress, and resolve potential blockers quickly.
● Sprint Review: At the end of each sprint, the implemented functionality will be
demonstrated to the project supervisor, with feedback integrated into the following
sprint cycle.
This iterative process ensures that the final prototype remains aligned with the project’s aims,
is thoroughly tested at each stage, and evolves into a robust and functional system.
Alongside the management framework, the technical methodology will follow a layered,
modular approach:

● System Architecture Design: Establishing the overall architecture, including
database schema, patient ID framework, and system APIs.
● Data Ingestion and Processing: Developing the OCR/NLP pipeline for automated
extraction of structured data from medical report PDFs.
● AI Model Development: Training and validating CNN and deep learning models for
both dental disease detection and chronic condition prediction.
● Integration and Testing: Incrementally integrating modules into the prototype,
followed by unit testing, integration testing, and evaluation against benchmark
metrics.
● Pilot Evaluation: Demonstrating the end-to-end workflow of the system using dental
and chronic disease datasets to validate feasibility.
This combination of Agile project management and modular technical methodology
ensures that LifeChain AI is developed systematically, with measurable progress and
adaptability to challenges.

5.2 System Architecture
The proposed LifeChain AI system will be implemented using a modern Three-Tier
Architecture, which separates the application into distinct logical and physical layers. This
architectural approach provides scalability, maintainability, and security, ensuring that the
system can evolve beyond the proof-of-concept stage into a deployable solution.
1. Presentation Tier (Frontend):
○ This tier provides the user interface (UI) through which clinicians, patients,
and administrators interact with the system.
○ A responsive, web-based application will be developed to ensure
accessibility across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
○ The UI will allow users to register patients, upload medical reports, visualize
family trees, and review AI-driven diagnostic insights.
○ Security features such as role-based access control and encrypted
communication (HTTPS) will be enforced at this level.
2. Application Tier (Backend):
○ This tier forms the core logic of the system. It will be implemented as a highperformance RESTful API (or GraphQL, depending on implementation
needs).
○ Responsibilities include:

10 of 16

■ User Authentication and Authorization
■ Data Ingestion and Processing (OCR, NLP, and computer vision
pipelines)
■ Business Logic for managing patient records, risk analysis, and alerts
■ Integration with AI Models for disease detection and progression
monitoring
■ Translation Services via integration with third-party APIs
○ The backend will be designed to ensure modularity, making it straightforward
to extend or replace components as new datasets and models are introduced.
3. Data Tier (Database):
○ This tier provides persistent and secure storage of all system data.
○ A relational database (such as PostgreSQL or MySQL) will be used to
manage structured patient data, medical records, and family tree relationships.
○ For graph-based operations, such as efficient traversal of hereditary links, a
graph database (e.g., Neo4j) may be used in parallel or integrated with the
relational schema.
○ All sensitive data will be stored in compliance with healthcare data security
standards, with encryption at rest and access control policies applied.
Together, these three tiers form a scalable and secure ecosystem. The frontend communicates
with the backend via secure APIs, the backend enforces logic and integrates AI/translation
services, and the database provides reliable storage and retrieval. This layered design ensures
the system can be maintained, extended, and scaled as the project evolves.
